    <h2>Changes in release 5.1.6p8 (04 Apr 2002)</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Merged in Paul Healy's p4 patch which provides
        <i>namespaces</i> and <i>afters</i> windows for examining entire
        namespaces or the after event timers.</li>
    <li>Fixed array checking. <i>array size</i> was use instead of
        <i>array exists</i> in some places which can cause an empty
        array to be treated as if it is a normal variable.</li>
    <li>Merged in Steve Landers code for Scripted Document
        support</li>
    </ul>
