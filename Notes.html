<center><h1>Tkinspect Notes</h1></center>

<b>tkinspect</b> started as a quick hack to help me debug my Tk
programs.  Since then, I've also used <b>tkinspect</b> to explore and
experiment with Tk programming.  What started out as a 150 line one
day hack has now been re-written twice and grown to over 3000 lines.
I'm still having a lot of fun programming in Tcl, and so I expect
<b>tkinspect</b> will continue to grow and evolve.<p>

<b>tkinspect</b> was written using a object system written in Tcl.
The object system is really just a way to group a Tcl array and a
bunch of procedures.  It's part of a larger Tcl library of mine called
<b>STL</b>.  <b>tkinspect</b> includes a subset of that library.<p>

<b>tkinspect</b> itself is public domain and you may do whatever you
want with it.  However, the Tcl code in the <tt>stl-lite</tt>
directory was written at LBL, so those files are copyright 1995
Lawrence Berkeley Lab.  See <tt>stl-lite/COPYRIGHT</tt> for the full
copyright notice.<p>

to me.  My address is <tt>SLShen@lbl.gov</tt>.
